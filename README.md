   # Hyperledger Fabric multi-nodes deployment in GCP # 


1. Modify src/main/resources/application.orgConfigs file. 
   Set gcloud.dir property to the directory where gcloud installed. Default value is /usr/bin/
   
   The default value of working.dir property is "./blockchain/artifacts/". The service will use that 
   directory to store templates and files generated by the service.
   
   The default value of domain property is "sample.com". The domain property will be used for setting 
   up the instance name, e.g orderer.sample.com.
       
2. In project directory, run  ./gradlew bootRun 

3. The restful service endpoint is POST: localhost:9000/gbaas/fabric?create_instance=false&install_software=false
   
   The request body looks like below:
   
   ```
